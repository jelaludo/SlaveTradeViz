    "description": "Slavery was fundamental to Roman society. Perhaps 10–30% of the Empire’s population were enslaved at some point, concentrated in Italy and large provincial estates. People were enslaved through war, piracy, sale of children, exposure of infants, and penal slavery. Prisoners of war from Gaul, Germania, Britain and the East were sold into Italian markets, with some campaigns—like Caesar in Gaul or the First Punic War—generating tens of thousands of captives. Unlike later Atlantic systems, Roman slavery was not race-based but rooted in conquest, status and law.",
    "ending": "Roman slavery never disappeared overnight but eroded over centuries. As imperial expansion slowed in the 2nd–3rd centuries CE, the supply of war captives shrank. Legal reforms, Christian moral critiques, and economic changes pushed landowners to rely more on tenant farmers (coloni) bound to the land rather than chattel slaves. By the late Empire and in successor kingdoms, slavery shaded gradually into forms of serfdom, with fewer large-scale markets and more local dependence ties.",
    "destinationDetails": {
      "Italy": "Italy—especially Rome and central Italian estates—was the core sink for enslaved people captured across the Empire. They worked in latifundia agriculture, urban households, workshops, mines and public construction. Many household slaves could be manumitted and become freedpersons, but plantation and mine labor remained brutal.",
      "Roman East": "In the eastern provinces (Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt), slavery was deeply embedded in cities and villas. A larger share of enslaved people worked as skilled laborers, administrators, tutors and domestic servants, though agricultural and quarry work were also common. Eastern markets redistributed captives from frontier wars and piracy.",
      "Provinces": "Outside Italy and the major eastern centers, provincial estates, mines and households absorbed captives from local rebellions, frontier wars and debt. In Gaul, Spain, North Africa and the Balkans, some enslaved people never left their home region but were pulled into the Roman legal and economic system as property."

Estimates suggest 6–10 million people, many of them women and children, were taken across the desert in caravans. Enslaved people worked as domestic servants, concubines, soldiers, oasis farmers and craftspeople in cities such as Cairo, Tunis, Fez and Tripoli. Mortality on desert crossings could be very high, and female captives were especially numerous in this system compared to the Atlantic trade.",
    "ending": "The Trans-Saharan slave trade declined gradually in the 19th and early 20th centuries. European conquest of North Africa and the Sahel disrupted caravan routes and imposed abolitionist laws; Ottoman reforms and Egyptian decrees formally banned slave trading; and new colonial border controls made large caravans harder to organize. Even after legal bans, forms of bondage and domestic slavery persisted in some Saharan and Sahelian societies well into the 20th century.",

The gender balance skewed heavily toward women and children in many routes.",
    "ending": "This trade declined unevenly. British naval patrols after the early 1800s targeted slave dhows in the western Indian Ocean; treaties with Oman and other Gulf rulers formally outlawed oceanic trafficking. France abolished slavery in the Mascarene Islands in the mid-19th century, and European colonial rule in East Africa restricted public slave markets.

    "description": "In 2021, around 49.6–50 million people were estimated to be in “modern slavery”: 27.6 million in forced labor and 22 million in forced marriage. These figures come from ILO, Walk Free and IOM modeling based on surveys and administrative data. Modern slavery includes exploitation in private economies, state-imposed labor, and coercive marriages across every region of the world.",
    "ending": "Modern slavery is formally illegal everywhere, but it persists because of conflict, weak labor enforcement, discrimination, migration vulnerability and profit incentives. International conventions (1926 Slavery Convention, 1956 Supplementary Convention, ILO conventions, the Palermo Protocol and national anti-trafficking laws) aim to eliminate it, and some countries have strengthened due-diligence and supply-chain laws. However, prevalence has increased between 2016 and 2021, especially in forced labor and forced marriage, showing that abolition on paper is not yet abolition in practice.",
    "destinationDetails": {
      "Forced Labor": "Forced labor covers people compelled to work under threats, debt or confiscated documents in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, agriculture, domestic work and fishing. Many victims are migrants working abroad without full legal protection.",
      "Forced Marriage": "Forced marriage includes situations where people—disproportionately women and girls—are married without free and informed consent, often facing lifelong domestic and sexual servitude. These arrangements may be framed as “traditional” but meet criteria for slavery-like practices.",
      "Sex Trafficking": "Sex trafficking involves the recruitment, transport or harboring of people for sexual exploitation through coercion, deception or abuse of vulnerability. Victims are found in brothels, massage parlors, online platforms and informal venues across all regions.",
      "State-Imposed": "State-imposed forced labor includes compulsory prison labor without due process, abusive conscription systems and forced participation in public works or political programs. Examples include prison camps, forced labor as punishment for dissent, and compulsory labor tied to ethnicity or religion."
