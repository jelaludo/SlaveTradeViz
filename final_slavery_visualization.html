        "description": "Slavery was fundamental to Roman society. Perhaps 10–30% of the Empire’s population were enslaved at some point, concentrated in Italy and large provincial estates. People were enslaved through war, piracy, sale of children, exposure of infants, and penal slavery. Prisoners of war from Gaul, Germania, Britain and the East were sold into Italian markets, with some campaigns—like Caesar in Gaul or the First Punic War—generating tens of thousands of captives. Unlike later Atlantic systems, Roman slavery was not race-based but rooted in conquest, status and law.",
        "ending": "Roman slavery never disappeared overnight but eroded over centuries. As imperial expansion slowed in the 2nd–3rd centuries CE, the supply of war captives shrank. Legal reforms, Christian moral critiques, and economic changes pushed landowners to rely more on tenant farmers (coloni) bound to the land rather than chattel slaves. By the late Empire and in successor kingdoms, slavery shaded gradually into forms of serfdom, with fewer large-scale markets and more local dependence ties.",
        "destinationDetails": {
            "Italy": "Italy—especially Rome and central Italian estates—was the core sink for enslaved people captured across the Empire. They worked in latifundia agriculture, urban households, workshops, mines and public construction. Many household slaves could be manumitted and become freedpersons, but plantation and mine labor remained brutal.",
            "Roman East": "In the eastern provinces (Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt), slavery was deeply embedded in cities and villas. A larger share of enslaved people worked as skilled laborers, administrators, tutors and domestic servants, though agricultural and quarry work were also common. Eastern markets redistributed captives from frontier wars and piracy.",
            "Provinces": "Outside Italy and the major eastern centers, provincial estates, mines and households absorbed captives from local rebellions, frontier wars and debt. In Gaul, Spain, North Africa and the Balkans, some enslaved people never left their home region but were pulled into the Roman legal and economic system as property."

        "description": "The Trans-Saharan trade linked West, Central and East Sudan to North Africa and the Middle East for over a millennium. Estimates suggest 6–10 million people, many of them women and children, were taken across the desert in caravans. Enslaved people worked as domestic servants, concubines, soldiers, oasis farmers and craftspeople in cities such as Cairo, Tunis, Fez and Tripoli. Mortality on desert crossings could be very high, and female captives were especially numerous in this system compared to the Atlantic trade.",
        "ending": "The Trans-Saharan slave trade declined gradually in the 19th and early 20th centuries. European conquest of North Africa and the Sahel disrupted caravan routes and imposed abolitionist laws; Ottoman reforms and Egyptian decrees formally banned slave trading; and new colonial border controls made large caravans harder to organize. Even after legal bans, forms of bondage and domestic slavery persisted in some Saharan and Sahelian societies well into the 20th century.",
        "destinationDetails": {
            "North Africa": "Across North Africa, enslaved people from West and Central Sudan labored in urban households, small workshops and agricultural estates. Cities such as Fez and Tlemcen relied on caravan routes bringing captives through oases like Timbuktu and Ghadames.",
            "Egypt": "Egypt was both a terminus and redistribution hub. Enslaved people worked in Cairo households and estates, in the army and in administrative roles. Nubia and Sudan supplied many captives to Egyptian markets, and some were marched onward to the Arabian Peninsula.",
            "Algeria": "Algerian cities such as Tlemcen and Algiers absorbed captives as domestic servants, artisans and rural laborers. Some West African captives were also re-exported towards the central Maghreb and the Ottoman world.",
            "Tunisia": "Tunis served as an important port and political center where enslaved people worked in elite households, workshops and agricultural domains. Caravans from the Sahara and Fezzan often converged on Tunisian markets.",
            "Libya": "Tripoli and other Libyan towns were key staging posts for desert caravans. Captives from the Sahel and central Sahara were sold into households, agriculture and service in Tripolitan coastal society or moved onward to the Ottoman Empire.",
            "Morocco": "Moroccan cities such as Marrakesh and Fez drew in enslaved people from caravan routes through the western Sahara. They were used in royal courts, urban households and irrigated agriculture.",
            "Ottoman Empire": "Some captives moving through North African ports were sent deeper into the Ottoman world—into Anatolia, the Levant and the Balkans—where they served in households, elite military units and rural estates.",
            "Middle East": "Beyond the formal Ottoman territories, desert and Red Sea routes brought enslaved Africans into Arabia and the broader Middle East, where they were integrated into domestic, pastoral and religious economies."

Captives were marched to Crimean ports such as Caffa and sold in markets that supplied the Ottoman Empire and the wider Middle East. Many were peasants seized in seasonal raids; some were nobles ransomed back to their families. The trade helped sustain the Crimean Khanate’s economy and its ties to Istanbul.",
        "ending": "The trade collapsed when Russian expansion pushed south. Major wars in the 17th–18th centuries weakened the Crimean Khanate, and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 1783 effectively ended large-scale raiding and slave markets there. New borders, fortified frontiers and changing military technology made steppe raids more difficult, while diplomatic pressure from European and Russian powers curtailed the export of Christian captives into the Ottoman world.",

Estimates cluster around 8 million people over the long run, with peaks in the 18th–19th centuries. Enslaved people labored in date plantations and pearl diving in the Gulf, on clove and sugar plantations in islands like Zanzibar and Réunion, as porters and soldiers in East Africa, and as domestic servants and concubines in Arabia, India and the wider Ottoman world. The gender balance skewed heavily toward women and children in many routes.",
        "ending": "This trade declined unevenly. British naval patrols after the early 1800s targeted slave dhows in the western Indian Ocean; treaties with Oman and other Gulf rulers formally outlawed oceanic trafficking. France abolished slavery in the Mascarene Islands in the mid-19th century, and European colonial rule in East Africa restricted public slave markets. Still, systems of domestic slavery and clientage persisted in parts of East Africa, Arabia and the Gulf into the early 20th century, only gradually dismantled by local abolition laws and international pressure.",

The largest single destination was Brazil, followed by Caribbean sugar islands and Spanish America. Only about 3–4% of captives were landed directly in what became the United States.
