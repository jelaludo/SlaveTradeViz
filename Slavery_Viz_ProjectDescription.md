Project Summary — The Scale of Slavery Throughout History

This project presents a unified, data-driven visualization of slavery across 2,700 years, from the Roman Empire to modern forced labor. Using a custom-built, horizontally flowing Sankey timeline, it aligns eight major slavery systems within a single comparative framework. Each system’s sources, flows, and destinations are mapped proportionally, revealing how different regions and periods contributed to global patterns of enslavement.

The visualization makes three contributions:

1. A Cross-Historical Comparison of Scale

By visualizing the estimated number of enslaved people in each system, the project contextualizes well-known trades—such as the Transatlantic and Trans-Saharan—alongside less familiar ones like the Crimean, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean networks. Modern slavery (≈50 million people) is displayed alongside historical systems, highlighting its unprecedented contemporary magnitude.

2. Geographic & Temporal Precision

Each system displays:

Exact time spans aligned on a shared BCE/CE timeline

Grouped source regions on the left and destination regions on the right

Tooltip details for every flow

Click-activated historical summaries for each destination

Write-ups on how each system ended, reflecting legal, political, economic, and military forces

3. A Public-Facing Educational Tool

The visualization integrates historical scholarship, peer-reviewed estimates, and regional breakdowns into a single interactive layout. It is designed for students, educators, researchers, and the general public seeking a clearer understanding of how different slavery systems functioned and how they compare in scale and duration.
